# Welcome to Foundations of Computing for Biologists

- Introductions

- Syllabus Overview and Questions
	
- Survey

- Overview of Operating Systems
  - Windows
  - Mac
  - Linux

- Some fundamentals
  - Memory (RAM)- information loaded to chips on computer to write information quickly; cannot save everything from laptop
  - File storage (hard drives)- slower to access and slower to read to
  - CPU- Central processing unit 
  - GPU- Graphical processing unit

- Unix Filesystem
	- [Filesystem overview](https://github.com/FoundCompBio-Spr24/Intro_Week1/blob/main/Filesystems.md)
 	- The Unix root (/)
   		- The very base of the filesystem (think about it as if its a manilla folder and its holding everything after that)
	- Absolute paths
		- All absolute paths begin at the root- start with / (as if you gave someone's full address)
	- Relative paths (depends on where you are right now)
		- Don't start with / !!!!
		- Working directories- every time you are logged in to your computer you are using a working directory; relative paths are relative to whatever your working directory is 
		- Shortcuts for current and parent directories
	- Hidden files and folders
		- Names begin with `.`
 		- "~" is home directory
     		- "cd" changes directory
   		- ".." means going backwards one directory
       		-"ls" lists the contents of the directory
		- Usually used for configuration files
